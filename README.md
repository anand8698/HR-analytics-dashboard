HR Analytics Dashboard: Description and Insights

 Objective:
The objective of this project was to create an HR Analytics Dashboard to help an organization improve employee performance and retention by analyzing key factors like attrition, job satisfaction, performance ratings, and compensation.

Process:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Unnecessary Columns Removed: We removed non-essential columns such as `EmpID`, `EmployeeCount`, `EmployeeNumber`, `Over18`, and `StandardHours` to focus on relevant data.
   - Missing Values Check: We checked for and confirmed there were no missing values in the dataset.

2. Interactive Dashboard Creation:
   - Tools Used: We utilized Plotly Dash, a Python framework for building web-based interactive dashboards.
   - Visualizations:
     - Attrition Analysis:- We visualized attrition rates by department, age group, and job role to understand where the organization is losing employees.
     - Performance vs. Satisfaction:- We analyzed the relationship between job satisfaction and performance ratings to identify trends and areas of improvement.
     - Compensation Analysis:- A histogram of monthly income helped us understand the income distribution across the organization.

3. Insights Derived:
   - Attrition by Department and Age:- Higher attrition rates in specific departments or among certain age groups could indicate underlying issues like job dissatisfaction or poor work-life balance.
   - Performance Correlation:- By examining job satisfaction against performance ratings, we identified how employee engagement directly impacts performance.
   - Income Distribution:- Understanding the spread of income helps in identifying any gaps or disparities that might lead to employee dissatisfaction.

 Conclusion:
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the factors influencing employee performance and retention. By making the data interactive, HR teams can drill down into specific areas to identify and address potential issues, ultimately leading to a more engaged and productive workforce.
